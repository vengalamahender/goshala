						and environment for sustainable, all inclusive holistic society. Towards spiritual factor, cow
						is called and respected as mother as she is abode of 33 crores of gods and goddesses. Her touch
						and contact gives healing effect to ill and her rearing earns virtue as Gau puja & Gaudaan are
						essential steps of all religious rituals. Her milk is equivalent to nectar. Her dung is
						excellent manure used for enhancement of agricultural productivity of fields. Her urine, apart
						from being a good component of manure, is a very good bio – pesticide and is being used to
						produce Gonvle, an alternative for conventional phenyl. Her calves are used for ploughing the
						fields for crop plantation and also to carry agricultural produce by small and marginal farmers.

						acids, cerebrocide, CLA & Strontium which contribute to all round development of human being.

						{' '}
						In the Srimad Bhagavatam it is said: {<b>gavah panca pavitrani:</b>} Cows deliver five products
						and all of them are pure and uncontaminated. The five products received from the cow are milk,
						ghee, yogurt, cow dung and urine. These five products, called pancha-gavya, are required in all
						ritualistic ceremonies performed according to the Vedic instructions. Cow’s milk is considered
						the most miraculous food which helps in developing the finer tissues of the brain that helps in
						understanding the higher purposes of life. It helps one understand the intricacies of
						transcendental knowledge. Milk can be transformed into yogurt, curd, butter, ghee and by
						combining the milk and milk products with grains; hundreds of palatable dishes can be prepared.
						The ghee or clarified butter is used not only for preparing delicacies but also for the
						sacrificial performances. A patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to
						overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. Even the urine
						and stool of cows have medicinal value. Cow dung contains all antiseptic properties and is
						considered a purifying agent. Cow dung can also be dried and used as fuel. The cow urine and
						dung are used even for bathing the deities. Panchagavya is made from cow’s milk , curd ,
						clarified butter , urine & dung mixed in a definite proportion. .Panchagavya should be made only
						from Indian breed cows , who are free to roam in the forests & pastures.
					</p>
					<h3>Ritual significance of Panchagavya</h3>
					<p>
						{' '}
						It is used in many ways . None of the auspicious rituals of Hindus are complete without this.
						Even today in every village & city of India, distribution of panchagavya is considered as a
						sacrament after celebration of festivals & rituals. It is also used for sanctification of house
						& the body. According to {<b>“dharmashastra”</b>} drinking of panchagavya as repentance for sins
						is prescribed. Before drinking panchgavya say the following – “ O Suryadev ! O Agnidev ! you are
						the destroyers of ailments of mind , body ,soul & even bones. I am drinking this ”. Repeat this
						3 times . Do not eat or drink anything for 2-3 hours after drinking panchgavya.
					</p>
					<h3>The medicinal significance of panchgavya</h3>
					<p>
						It is considered as a medicine in Ayurveda . If all the 5 are mixed in the right proportion and
						taken as prescribed then it is panacea. Body’s immunity is increased & diseases kept away by
						drinking panchgavya. All the constituents , both alone & together have great medicinal value
						that too without any side effects. Apart from that if we are taking any other ayurvedic medicine
						then panchgavya acts as a catalyst.
					</p>
					<h3 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Cow – The Worshippable Animal</h3>
					<p>
						The cows are an integral part of the temples and their upkeep is one of the prime activities. In
						India, most of the Vaishnava temples have their own Goshala. The unadulterated milk supplied by
						these {<b>cows is used for the worship of the Lord.</b>}
					</p>
					<p style={{ color: 'red', textAlign: 'center' }}>
						rinodakadi samyuktam yah pradadyat gavahnikam so asvamedha samam punyam labhate natra samsayah
					</p>
					<p>
						In Brihat Parashara Smriti (5.26-27) it is said that one who feeds the cow with grass and water
						every day derives the benefit equivalent to performing Ashwamedha Yajna.
